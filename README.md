## Create your personalized NPX introduction card

### Step 1: Select a Unique Package Name

Choose a distinctive name for your package, as it will be the identifier for invoking your introduction command using `npx`.

### Step 2: Establish a New Directory

Create a fresh directory for your package, naming it after the chosen package name.

```bash
mkdir npx-username
cd npx-username
```

### Step 3: Initialize Your Package

Initialize your project as a Node.js package using the command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

### Step 4: Develop an Executable Script

Within your project directory, create a JavaScript file named `index.js` and store it in a folder named `bin`. This file will function as the executable script for your npx command.

Ensure to specify the `bin` field in `package.json`:

```json
"bin": {
  "username": "./bin/index.js"
}
```

**Ensuring Script Execution Capability:**

To enable script execution, follow these steps:

For Mac/Linux:

```bash
chmod +x bin/index.js
```

For Windows:

```bash
git update-index --chmod=+x bin/index.js
```

### Step 5: Add your script to execute and display in terminal

Execute your script with the following command:

```bash
node bin/index.js
```

### Step 6: Publish the package 

Once your script runs successfully, publish the package:

**1. Log in to npm:**

```bash
npm adduser
```

**2. After logging in, return to the terminal and run:**
```bash
npm publish
```

### Step 7: Execute Your NPX Command

Once the package is published, run your npx command:

```bash
npx username
```

Follow these steps to create your personalized NPX introduction command and share it with others!
